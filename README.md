ðŸ“Š Sales Data Analysis & Dashboard Visualization
# Project Overview
This project focuses on performing data analysis on a sales dataset, resolving common data issues like missing values and outliers, and visualizing key insights. Using Python and Power BI, the project reveals trends, sales performance, and customer insights through interactive dashboards.

## Key Features
Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, removed outliers, and optimized data for analysis using Python and Pandas.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Initial visualizations and insights generated using Matplotlib and Plotly.
Dashboard Creation: Built an interactive dashboard using Power BI, showcasing sales trends, profit margins, top customers, and geographical sales distribution.

## Tech Stack
Jupyter Notebook: For data loading, cleaning, and preprocessing using Pandas.
Python: To resolve missing values and outliers, perform exploratory data analysis.
Matplotlib & Plotly: For basic visualizations and data exploration.
Power BI: To create a comprehensive dashboard for data visualization and business insights.

## Project Files
salesdata.csv: Raw sales data used for analysis.
Project 2 Sales.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization code.
Dashboard.png: Screenshot of the Power BI dashboard.

## Dashboard Overview
The Power BI dashboard provides a visual summary of:

Total Sales: Aggregate sales performance across different categories.
Profit Margins: Analysis of profit by category (Office Supplies, Technology, Furniture).
Top 5 Customers: Customers contributing the most to overall sales.
Sales by State: Geographical breakdown of sales performance.
Sales Trends: Performance across sub-categories such as phones, storage, chairs, etc.

Jupyter Notebook: Open the Project 2 Sales.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook to explore the data cleaning and visualization process.
Power BI: The dashboard can be recreated or customized in Power BI using the cleaned dataset.
Dependencies: Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:
Pandas
Matplotlib
Plotly
Insights & Learnings
Data Cleaning: Efficient handling of missing values and outliers ensures better data integrity.
Visualization: Visualizing data in Power BI allows for more intuitive insights into business performance.
Customer Insights: The project demonstrates the importance of identifying top customers and understanding their purchasing behavior for sales growth.
Future Enhancements
Automating the data pipeline for real-time insights.
Expanding the dashboard to include more advanced metrics such as Customer Retention Rate, Year-over-Year growth, etc.
Integrating machine learning models for sales prediction and trend analysis.
